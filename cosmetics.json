The all-new paddle-shaped tip gives\n you two looks in one—thick and dramatic or thin and elegant. The \nintense black formula glides on smoothly and dries quickly for instant \ndrama. Clinically tested, suitable for sensitive eyes.Directions: Stand 6 inches away from a mirror and tilt your chin up, so \nthat when you look down your nose into the mirror, you can see your \nentire eyelid. Dab concealer or dust translucent powder on your upper \nlids. Blend well with a sponge or lightly pat with a fingertip to cover \nveins and prevent creasing.Before applying liner, \ndetermine your eye shape. If eyes are close-set or round, line only the \nouter corners. Otherwise, line the entire upper lid.Gently pull your eyelid taut at an upward angle. Beginning at the inner \ncorner, draw small, connected dashes along the top lashes. Be sure to \nstay close to the roots so there is no skin visible between the lashes \nand the liner. To make eyes look bigger, extend the liner slightly \nbeyond the outer corners.Use a cotton swab to fix mistakes. For larger messes, dip it in makeup remover.",

      "description": "This is so new, it’s hopping right off the Milan runway and into your makeup bag. A truly next-level eyeliner, it gets its richness from a black base that blasts the luminosity, creating a shiny, shimmery special effect that lights up your eyes. Blackened jewel tones with a foil finish, these can be used for lining or a full-on lid look. And there are two great ways to play these blendable beauties: For a “classic cat” look, extend the color just past the lashline. For a “smoldering smoky” vibe, gently blend upward from the lashline to the crease. Available in four chic shades - Black Gold Foil, Brown Foil, Purple Foil and Navy Foil – with a custom pro brush that deposits color exactly where you want it. Glow for it.Features:2-in-1 liner create a classic cat eye to smoldering smokey lookThe innovative blackout base enhances the pigment luminosity, creating a shiny special effect that brightens eyesProfessional brush applicator includedAvailable in four long-wearing shadesEasy to useApplication: Gently glide the tip of the applicator brush over color. Apply product by gliding brush along lashline from inner to outer corner of the eye. For the Classic Cat Eye: Slightly extend the end of the liner past the lashline.
